# iptracker
my ISP keeps changing my public IP address and breaking outside access to my home server. This simple bash script can be used with a cron job to keep an eye on your public IP and email you when it changes.

This version requires the "Dropbox/IPADDRESS" directory in your home directory BUT you can replaace it with whatever. Just makes it so you can reference the IP at any given point.
